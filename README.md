My name is Michael John Pulusan. I'm a full-stack web developer with a strong foundation in modern technologies like TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQLâ€”gained through 800+ hours of immersive training at LearningFuze. I thrive in collaborative, Agile environments where I can build meaningful, user-centered applications.

My transition into tech follows nearly a decade of experience in high-stakes technical rolesâ€”from software deployment engineering at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise to clinical lab work in healthcare. These roles sharpened my problem-solving, communication, and process-driven thinkingâ€”skills I now bring to every line of code and team project.

Most recently, I built SpecKids, a full-stack capstone app supporting kids with spectrum conditions through screen-time management, therapy schedules, and creative toolsâ€”all in a playful, accessible interface.

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with clean code, smart design, and a user-first mindset.
