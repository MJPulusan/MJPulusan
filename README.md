**About Me**
--

My name is Michael John Pulusan. I'm a full-stack web developer with a strong foundation in modern technologies like TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL—gained through 800+ hours of immersive training at LearningFuze. I thrive in collaborative, Agile environments where I can build meaningful, user-centered applications.

My transition into tech follows nearly a decade of experience in high-stakes technical roles—from software deployment engineering at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise to clinical lab work in healthcare. These roles sharpened my problem-solving, communication, and process-driven thinking—skills I now bring to every line of code and team project.

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with clean code, smart design, and a user-first mindset.
